3D Printers that are compatible with MAYER MAKES Engineering Resin:

In general almost all commonly available Printers are expected to be compatible.
Known incompatible brands: Formlabs

Exemplary compatible models:
Wanhao
	D7/D8
Anycubic
	photon
	photon s
	photon mono (all variants)
	photon mono X (all variants)
Elegoo
	Mars (all variants)
	Saturn (all variants)
Longer	
	Orange (all variants)
Phrozen 
	Sonic(all variants)
Prusa
	SL1
	SL1s
If your printer uses 395-405nm UV Spectrum it is very likely to be compatible.


if you cannot find a ready made profile on our Github you can easily derive it from a similar printers settings.
here are some general guidelines:

For older 3d printers(without monochromatic screen)
				Bottom layer 50-60sek
				normal Layer 10-15sek
				
For modern 3d printers (with monochromatic screen)
				Bottom layer 20-30sek
				normal Layer 5-8sek
				
FOR ALL 3d printers: 
				Lift 6-10mm (it is recommended to use 10 for safer peeling and giving the Resin time to flow back)
				Print at around 20°C, the Resin can be to viscous when it has below 15°C
